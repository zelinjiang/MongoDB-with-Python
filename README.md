# MongoDB-with-Python

Hey there, welcome!         

This is an introduction of how to comnnect MongoDB, create databases, create collections, query and update MongoDB with Python.         

This tutorial consists of 4 files:       
- 0 - samples_pokemon.zip
- 1 - Connecting MongoDB Server and Do Simple Queries.py
- 2 - Comprehensive Project - Scrape(BeautifulSoup), Store, and Query the Yelp Top 40 Donut Shops in San Francisco.py
- 3 - Comprehensive Project 2 - Scrape(Selenium) and Store the Top 100 San Francisco Companies on Zippia.py

The first file is a sample database 'Pokemon', which consists of some charasters of Pokemon that I don't know any of them.             

The second file is a Python code that shows how to connect you local MongoDB server, and make queries. The query is writen in the comments.          

The third and fourth file are two comprehensive End-to-End projects that use both Web-scraping and MongoDB. They start from scraping the data from webpages and store the information into the database-collection created. Then the program will scrape some more information and update them into the database.           
If you already know well about Web-scraping then they should be understandable, but if you are not, I highly recommend you go through my previous repo 'Web-scraping with BeautifulSoup and Selenium', after you finished the 6 exercises there, you will be very fluent in web-scraping.
